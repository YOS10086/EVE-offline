    ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.15 16:31:02 ] Trog Caverna > Si1ver Eyez Before actually trying to go into a wormhole to scan, you might want to practice making a safe in an area that isn't quite as dangerous as wormhole space.</p>

Electronic interference floods through your ship's systems only moments after your warp drive locks on and activates, growing in ferocity as you are hurled towards the strange phenomenon.</p>

    ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.15 17:26:25 ] Trog Caverna > Si1ver Eyez I ocassionally run around in WHs. It can be lucrative but be prepared to lose some ships. The trick is to get good enough at it that your gains more than offset your ship losses.</p>

    ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.15 17:29:42 ] Trog Caverna > Fairy Manu PI1 he is one day old. The learning curve is steep enough here the obvious might not jump right out. Hate to see him get discouraged because of a few ship losses :)</p>
    ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.15 17:31:32 ] Space Dandy's PIAlt1 > Trog Caverna Talking to someone like they're think is a bad idea imo. I mean, so what their char is 1 day old? Are they an alt or a returning player? Oh - you don't know that? Oh. If you don't, how do think you get to talk to people like they're simple? Also, "make more than you lose" is not exactly a fkn revelation. If you think it is then I would suggest it is you that needs the help. Dumb cunt.</p>

But next time you think it might be a good idea to try to bandwagon on someone make sure they're not as pointlessly stupid and irrelevent as you are. Better luck next time.Also     *arse. An ass is a donkey. Stupid colonial.</p>
