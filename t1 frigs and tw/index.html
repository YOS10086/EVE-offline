  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 22:54:06 ] Shingetsu > so can you confirm this by not not listening to the "news"</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 22:54:56 ] Malachir > the only way there is any dirt on them, would be confirmed by sudden memorials</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 22:59:21 ] Shingetsu > can go both ways</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:00:32 ] Archdemon Mammon > thats very B of you</p>

  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:21:25 ] Archdemon Mammon > is there a way to pvp without losing your ship?</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:21:57 ] Sophia Koblenko > destroying your oppenent's ship before he destroys yours</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:22:21 ] Archdemon Mammon > can i fight people in high sec?</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:22:27 ] Sophia Koblenko > you can</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:23:31 ] Archdemon Mammon > will concord kill me?</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:23:37 ] Sophia Koblenko > you can challenge them to a duel. you can flag in the hopes they attack you, so you can fight back without concord interference</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:24:00 ] Sophia Koblenko > of you're in a structure owning corp, you can wardec other corps that have structures</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:24:04 ] Sophia Koblenko > if*</p>

  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:26:28 ] Sophia Koblenko > if you want to experience pvp, a good way (imo) to start is to join faction war</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:27:40 ] Sophia Koblenko > you can do this by yourself, use throw-away t1 ships and probably lose a lot, but you will gain experience without it costing an arm and a leg</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:28:21 ] Archdemon Mammon > so dont use my harbinger?</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:28:46 ] Sophia Koblenko > well, if a harbinger is expensive to you, then i wouldnt</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:29:04 ] Sophia Koblenko > you can fit a t1 frigate for about a mil per hull.</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:29:32 ] Archdemon Mammon > i have a harbinger navy issue and it took forever to get saved up</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:29:52 ] Archdemon Mammon > by forever imean about a day</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:30:32 ] Sophia Koblenko > okay :) it's up to you, but you can lose it very quickly in a bad encounter</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:31:04 ] Archdemon Mammon > eww is so much eeww</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:32:39 ] Sophia Koblenko > i think if you go out in a faction bc without much experience, you'll just end up losing it in a dissapointing way</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:33:35 ] Archdemon Mammon > ahh ok</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:33:36 ] Sonic XIII > Предложение гиперсети: Rattlesnake*</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:34:06 ] Sophia Koblenko > the idea behind using t1 frigates is that you get a feel and experience without risking much isk</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:34:20 ] Archdemon Mammon > gotcha</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:34:33 ] Archdemon Mammon > so what is faction warfare about</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:35:47 ] Sophia Koblenko > my own experience was just limited to finding small scale fights, but i guess there is also capturing territory component to it</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:36:46 ] Sophia Koblenko > and atleast when i played in it, there were also fleet ops where we'd raid roam around and try to find fleet encounters with the other faction or pirates</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:38:21 ] Sophia Koblenko > but this was around 2012, i don'\t know how it is now</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:38:53 ] Archdemon Mammon > nice....sorry my wife made some monkey bread</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:39:02 ] Archdemon Mammon > i've eaten so much of it >.></p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:46:27 ] Sophia Koblenko > hadnt heard of it,  but it looks tasty</p>
  ﻿<p>[ 2019.12.16 23:49:47 ] Archdemon Mammon > yeah me either but now i'm sugared up</p>
